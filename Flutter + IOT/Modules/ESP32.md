###  How to Program ESP32:

1. **Use Arduino IDE** (or PlatformIO, ESP-IDF)
    
2. **Install ESP32 board** in IDE
    
3. **Connect via USB**
    
4. **Write & upload code**
    


```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin("YourSSID", "YourPassword");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting...");
  }
  Serial.println("Connected!");
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here (read sensor, send data)
}
```

###  ESP32 + Flutter Integration

- Use **MQTT**, **HTTP**, or **BLE** to send data between ESP32 and Flutter.
    
- Example: ESP32 reads temperature → sends via MQTT → Flutter app receives and displays.
